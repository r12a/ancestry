Partly due to the opposition of the Conservative party and the House of Lords, this did not take place until 1914.",

	"year: 1883",
	"date: 1 Jan",
	"note: The 1870 Married Women's Property Act changed the previous legal situation, in which all property automatically transferred to the control of a husband on marriage, granting limited protection to a married woman's property allowing women to retain up to £200 of their own wages or earnings.
